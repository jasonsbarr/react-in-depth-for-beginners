# Learn React in-depth tutorial series

## Brief Description
Join us as we build GetItDone, a full-stack task manager application, and get to know the ins and outs of React in detail along the way!

## Full Description

This tutorial series is for beginning React developers and anyone else who wants to get up-to-date in their understanding of React! We'll build GetItDone, a full-stack task manager application.

We'll examine key React features in-depth, of course. We'll also use other key packages from the React/NPM ecosystem. That way you can see how top-notch engineers use the tools at their disposal to rapidly build complex applications.

You'll learn in-depth about how React works, but that's not all. You'll also learn the problems it solves and best practices for building robust, performant UIs that are a pleasure to both use _and_ build.

The series will focus on building functionality, but you can't build modern apps without thinking about UX and good design. We'll build a clean, simple, and intuitive UI that uses solid design practices. We'll also use modern styling techniques and a component library to help you get familiar with the relevant tools.

We're going to go all the way from "Hello, world" in React to building a full-fledged application with advanced React features. You'll learn the ins and outs of React development at a deep level.
